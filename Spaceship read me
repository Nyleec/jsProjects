# Welcome to My Spaceship
Welcome to My Spaceship it implementsa hash table and a ton of if statements I left some comments for ya.

## Task
imagine a coordinate graph give a spaceship a starting point of 0,0 and facing up. find the end coordinates and direction at the end of a list of instructions.

## Description
I used a hash table and simple addition to find the direction of the spaceship. and if statements to find the coordinates.

## Installation
down load the spaceship.js file and load a list of instructions such as "RRRAAAALLLL" where R and L are directions for turn left or turn right. and A is dor advance.

## Usage
if you want to know where and which direction a spaceship is facing at the end of a route simply use the above.
